We specialized in creating online advertisements for major brands around the globe. A few of the brands we worked with included REI, Disney, Sephora, Samsung, Lexus, and many others.\r\n\r\nMy role on the Say Media team was quality insurance, ensuring that our advertisements would function as advertised in as many scenarios as we could conceive, and on as many devices as we had available. Requiring high attention to detail, the experience I\'ve gained from this position has given me a sharp eye and a knack for finding and fixing even the smallest of bugs or discrepancies.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Say Media was bought out in late 2018 and a decision by the new owners was made to close the advertisement segment of the business, which included my position, eventually, this led to the entire Portland office be closed down. However, as the saying goes, when one door closes, another door opens, and I was able to secure a position as a developer for long-standing and respected design and development agency Gravitate Design Studios.","Say Media","","publish","open","open","","say-media","","","2019-07-28 17:28:38","2019-07-28 17:28:38","",0,"http://newportfolio.local.com/?p=41",0,"post","",0),

My contribution to the team includes custom development to expand the functionality of sites, improve the user experience, fix bugs and issues that may arise, and keeping sites secure and up to date.
